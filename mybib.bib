  abstract = {A study was conducted during 2002-05 for optimization of virus dosage for efficient dispersal of virus to ensure maximized disease transmission, suppression of beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros L). To suppress the pest, baculovirus was released for the first time in 1987 at Hut bay, Little Andaman, which eventually brought down palm damage to insignificant levels within 4 years of release. However during 2000-01 fresh outbreak of coconut rhinoceros beetle was noticed warranting release of virus through infected beetles at a dose of 130 Î¼g of Crude Virus Preparation/beetle for efficient dispersal of virus. Release of 135 virus inoculated beetles at 3 locations in Little Andaman's resulted in over 99\% reduction in palm damage by 36th month of augmentation. Examination of trapped adults confirmed 3.6-fold increase in prevalence of virus with the reduction in breeding sites.},
